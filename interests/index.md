## Security Education

The gap between hacker threats and suitable security defenses is widening, and the types and numbers of threats are changing faster than ever before. In addition, the gulf in the number of security professionals we have and the number we need is widening. To meet this need in the short and the long term, we need new education solutions to keep developers informed of the latest in secure design and development. In the Fall of 2014, the Realsearch group presented a new MOOC that covers these important security topics. As part of this work we show the effectiveness of MOOCs as an educational tool and a method for increasing outreach to new individuals in this area.
