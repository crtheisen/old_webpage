## 2014, 2016: Software Security - Google Coursebuilder (2014) and OpenEDx (2017)

In the Fall of 2014, I was the Teaching Assistant alongside [Laurie Williams](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/index.html) and [Emerson Murphy Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) for a free, open platform MOOC on software security with 400+ students. The course featured lectures from Dr. Williams, technical and design exercises from me, and roundtable discussions on the latest security news every week with all of the instructors. We had a 10% retention rate through the course - quite good for this type of course (typical retention rates are 3-5%).

We reran the course in the Fall of 2016, improving the course based on the feedback we received. The second iteration of the course was run on the OpenEDx platform using Amazon AWS, and featured over 1,000 students, with approximately 20% recieving a certificate of completion at the end of the course. This doubled the retention rate of the 2014 course.

## 2013, 2014, 2016: Software Security - Classroom

I was the teaching assistant in the Fall of 2013, 2014, and 2016 for the graduate course in Software Security at NCSU. Laurie Williams designed and taught the course both semesters, while I gave lectures, designed projects and assignments, and graded student work.
